I am the very model of a Kubernetes Admin
I'm knowledgeable replicating, deploying, and networking
I know the use of syntax, and I quote the configs functioning
From journal-d to fluent-d, in order of the processing

I'm very well acquainted, too, with matters troubleshootable
I understand the failures, both the simple and systemical
About DNS queries I'm teeming with resolution
With many cheerful facts on Core-DNS configuration

With many cheerful facts on Core-DNS configuration
With many cheerful facts on Core-DNS configuration
With many cheerful facts on Core-DNS configuration

I'm very good with storage that's only needed ephemerally
I know the storage types that need to  be kept persistently 
In short, in matters file sharing, config-map, and secret add in
I am the very model of a Kubernetes Admin

In short, in matters file sharing, config-map, and secret add in
He is the very model of a Kubernetes Admin

I know kubelet config, static pod and systemCTL
I search through log histories, I've a pretty taste for regex hell
I write in YAML all the API’s that are notable
I can redirect ports to an ingress point exposable

I roll out upgrades across an entire clusters of nodes 
I stage this with aptitude or yum update codes
Then plan and apply the upgrade using only-kube ADM
With the confidence and accuracy, of a certified admin

The confidence and accuracy, of a certified admin
The confidence and accuracy, of a certified admin
The  confidence and accuracy, of a certified admin

Then I  write a bash script to loop through a file create
And run a web service only once the file is locate
In short, in commands creatable, editable, and readable
I am the very model of a Kubernetes Admin

In short, in commands creatable, editable, and readable
He is the very model of a Kubernetes Admin

In fact, I know exactly what is meant by "encoded" and "encrypted"
One of these you should not have your password entrusted
And you certainly would never pass them as environmental variables
Because that would definitely leave me with many dissaprovables

I tmux hotkey to perform multi-terminal switchery
For simultaneous command input battery
In short, when I’m bashing out configurations dextrously
You'll say a better administrator had never hit a key

You'll say a better administrator had never hit a key
You'll say a better administrator had never hit a key
You'll say a better administrator had never hit a key

For my Kubernetes knowledge, though I'm plucky and adventurous
Has only been learned down to the beginning of the syllabus
But still, in matters YAML, Kubecuddle , and API controlling
I am the very model of a Kubernetes Admin

But still, in matters YAML, Kubecuddle, and API controlling
He is the very model of a Kubernetes Admin
