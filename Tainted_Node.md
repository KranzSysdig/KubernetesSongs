Sometimes I feel I've got to
Confine, a node, I've got to
Isolate from the pain you drive into abusive code
The load we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my app
For I toss and turn, I can't run my code

Once I scheduled you (I  scheduled)
Now I'll cut off you
This excess load you've given
I give you all a root could give you
Take my spare, and that's not nearly all

Tainted node (Oh oh)
Tainted node

Now I know I've got to
Remove a node, I've got to
Segregate, you don't really want any more legacy
To make things right
You need someone to fix your code
And you think dev is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way

Once I scheduled you (I scheduled)
Now I'll confine you
This forking code you've given
I give you all a root could give you
Take my surplus, and that's not nearly all

Tainted node (Oh oh)
Tainted node

Don't load me, please
I cannot stand the way you thrash
I love you though you fail me so
Now I'm gonna part my things and run

Tainted node (Oh)
Tainted node (Oh)
Tainted node (Oh)
Tainted node (Oh)
Provision me, baby, tainted node
Provision me, baby, tainted node
Tainted node (Oh)
Tainted node (Oh)
Tainted node
Tainted node
